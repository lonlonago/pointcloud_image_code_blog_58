##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  The registration accuracy of the point cloud adopts the root mean square error RMSE. The smaller the root mean square error, the higher the registration accuracy; the degree of overlap is to calculate the proportion of the nearest neighbor pairs to all points. The larger the degree of overlap, the better the registration effect. See the algorithm source code for the specific calculation process.
