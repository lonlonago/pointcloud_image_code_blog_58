##  I. Overview 

  Calculating the maximum distance between points in the same point cloud is an important step in the overlap estimation in the 4PCS registration algorithm, and is the basis for realizing handwritten 4PCS and improving it. To this end, the Open3D implementation is used to obtain the maximum distance in a given point cloud set, and return the minimum and maximum coordinate points
