##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Calculation formula 

  Calculate the normalized 3x3 covariance matrix and centroid for a given set of points. Normalization means that each item in the matrix is divided by the number of valid point clouds. For a small number of points, or if explicit sample variance is required, use the scaled covariance matrix, where the number of points used to calculate the covariance matrix is used. The formula is: where is the point in the point cloud, is the centroid of the point cloud.
