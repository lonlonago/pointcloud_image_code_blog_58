   Assuming that the rigid body coordinate system is the rotation angle of B (Oxyz) about the axis represented by the unit vector, its corresponding rotation matrix can be deduced. First, assume that the axis of the rigid body coordinate system B coincides with any axis represented, and then the rotation angle of the B coordinate system around the Z axis of the reference coordinate system A (OXYZ) is such that the projection of the axis in the XOY plane coincides with the X axis, and then around the angle, the z axis and the Z axis coincide, and then around the Z axis rotation angle. Finally, in order to make z return to the position coinciding with the axis, the rotation angle around the Y axis and the rotation angle around the Z axis can be used, as shown in the figure below.
