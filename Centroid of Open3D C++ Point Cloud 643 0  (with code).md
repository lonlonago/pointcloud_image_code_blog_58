##  Centroid 

  The centroid of a face is the geometric center of a cross-sectional figure. The centroid is for a physical body, while the centroid is for abstract geometry. For a physical body of uniform density, the centroid and centroid coincide. The geometric center or centroid of an object in dimensional space is the intersection of all hyperplanes that divide into two equal parts of the moment. Informally, it is the average of all points in it. If the mass of an object is evenly distributed, the centroid is the center of gravity. - Baidu Encyclopedia
