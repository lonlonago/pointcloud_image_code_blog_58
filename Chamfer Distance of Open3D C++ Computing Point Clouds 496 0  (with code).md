##  I. Overview of algorithms 

  The Chamfer Distance distance can calculate the average shortest point distance between the generated point cloud data and the labeled point cloud data. Open3D can be directly used to calculate the Chamfer Distance distance of the point cloud. For more details on the application of the Chamfer Distance in point clouds, please refer to: PCL calculation of point cloud chamfer distance (Chamfer Distance) or master's thesis: [1] Zhang Yonghan. Research on monocular vision 3D point cloud reconstruction technology based on deep learning [D]. Northeast Electric Power University, 2020. I won't go into too much detail here.
