##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  Different sampling devices and different distances from the scene will cause differences in point cloud density. Existing methods for estimating point cloud density include distance-based methods and block-based methods. The distance-based average distance density representation method is to estimate the distribution density of point clouds by calculating the average distance of each point in the point cloud. The distance of a point is generally the distance between a point in the point cloud and the point closest to the point in the point cloud. In a point cloud with a number of points, the distance between a point and any other point is expressed, and the minimum distance between a point and other points is expressed. Then the average distance density of the point cloud is: the smaller the average distance, the denser the point cloud distribution, and the greater the density; the larger, the sparser the point cloud distribution, and the smaller the density. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate the point cloud density by the average distance.
