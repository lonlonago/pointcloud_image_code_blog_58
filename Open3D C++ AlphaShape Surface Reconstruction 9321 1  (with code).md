##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###   1. Overview of the principle 

   Alpha-shape is a generalization of the convex hull algorithm. One can intuitively think of alpha-shape as follows: Imagine a large piece of ice cream containing dots of S chocolate chunks. Using one of these spherical ice cream spoons, we can cut out all the parts of the ice cream chunks, and we can dig holes inside without touching the chocolate chunks (e.g., parts that cannot be reached by just moving the spoon from the outside). We end up with a (not necessarily convex) object, which consists of vertices, arcs, and points. If we now straighten all the round faces into triangles and line segments, we can visually describe the so-called alpha shape.
